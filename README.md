Netflix Movies vs TV Series--Project-1 I used the Netflix dataset from Kaggle. It is for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

Motivation of project Following the CRISP_DM methodology I used the Netflix dataset to analyse themost watched content on their platform. The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/dataset-netflix-shows

The questions that will be focused on are :

1.what is the most content watched on Netflix and why

2.In which year were the highest 'type' released and opinion after finding

3.Country producing the most content watched?

The link to my notebook is also attached in the repository

The following libraries were used:

• Numpy

• Pandas

• Matplotlib

• Seaborn

Summary of the results

• Numbers suggest that Movies are most watched content than TV Series

I have written a block on Medium.for more info pls find the below link

• Most TV series watched are for Mature Audience

• TV Series has a significant portion of the shows that have not progressed beyond their initialfirst season. This might influnce the audience to watch more standalone content

United States are the most creators of the content watched for Movies and forTV Series and Korea and Japan are producing TV Series more that movies
